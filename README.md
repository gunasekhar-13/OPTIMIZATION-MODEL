*I use google colab to do this project.And I refer google and pdf that codetech it solutions provide.This project demonstrates how to apply linear programming (LP) to solve a real-world business problemâ€”optimizing the production strategy of a manufacturing company to maximize profit. The company produces two products: Product A and Product B. Each product contributes differently to the profit and consumes different amounts of resources such as machine time and raw materials. The goal is to determine how many units of each product the company should produce within the available resource constraints in order to achieve the maximum possible profit.*
